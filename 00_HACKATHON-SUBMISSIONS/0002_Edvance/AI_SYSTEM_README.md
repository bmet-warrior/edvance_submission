# AI-Powered Pre-Submission Filter System

## 🎯 Overview

This AI system reduces repetitive questions in discussion forums by analyzing student questions before they're posted. It searches through past Q&As and teacher-uploaded materials to provide immediate answers when confident, only escalating to human discussion when necessary.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **AI-First Question Flow**
- Students click "Ask AI First" instead of posting directly
- AI analyzes the question using semantic search
- Provides immediate answers when confident (>80%)
- Only posts to forum when AI is uncertain

### 2. **Document Knowledge Base**
- Teachers upload course materials (PDF, Word, txt)
- Automatic text extraction and processing
- Semantic search through uploaded content
- Source attribution for all AI responses

### 3. **Smart Confidence Scoring**
- Analyzes similarity between question and knowledge base
- Confidence threshold determines auto-response vs escalation
- Shows confidence scores to teachers for quality control

### 4. **Seamless Integration**
- Works with existing class structure (FINC3012, AMME2000, etc.)
- Maintains current UI/UX patterns
- Progressive enhancement - works without JavaScript

## 🚀 How It Works

### Student Workflow:
1. Click "Ask AI First" in any class forum
2. Type question and details
3. AI searches past Q&As and course materials
4. If confident answer found → Immediate response with sources
5. If uncertain → Option to post to human forum

### Teacher Workflow:
1. Upload course materials (syllabus, assignments, notes)
2. System processes and indexes content
3. Review AI responses and mark as correct/incorrect
4. Monitor analytics on questions filtered vs posted

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Core Components:
- **Document Upload API** (`/api/upload-documents`)
- **AI Analysis Pipeline** (`/api/ai-prefilter`)
- **Question Modal Component** (`AIQuestionModal.tsx`)
- **Document Upload Component** (`DocumentUpload.tsx`)

### AI Processing:
- Text extraction from PDFs, Word docs, plain text
- Semantic similarity matching
- Confidence scoring algorithm
- Source attribution and citation

### Data Storage:
- Course materials stored per class
- Past Q&As indexed for semantic search
- Demo mode uses localStorage
- Production ready for database integration

## 📊 Expected Impact

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone openai pdf-parse mammoth multer
   ```

2. **Environment Variables:**
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Usage:**
   - Teachers: Use "Upload Course Materials" button
   - Students: Click "Ask AI First" instead of regular question posting

- **Advanced NLP Models** for better understanding
- **Analytics Dashboard** for teachers
- **Multi-language Support**
- **Integration with LMS systems**

## 🎓 Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Assignment Details**
- Student: "What's the word limit for Assignment 1?"
- AI finds: Assignment brief → "Based on Assignment 1 Brief uploaded by Dr. Chen, the maximum word limit is 2000 words."
- Result: ✅ Immediate answer, no forum post needed

**Scenario 2: Complex Concept**
- Student: "How do I approach the derivatives pricing model?"
- AI searches but finds no confident match
- Result: ➡️ Escalated to human forum for detailed discussion

This system transforms reactive forums into proactive learning environments, dramatically improving efficiency and educational outcomes! 🚀
