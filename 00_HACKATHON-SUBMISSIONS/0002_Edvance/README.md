## üöÄ Project overview
**Edvance** is a discussion forum for students and educators with an AI assistant that answers recurring administrative questions using only **teacher-uploaded documents** and the **teacher‚Äôs past replies**. This keeps answers authoritative and aligned with course standards. Students can post, reply and upvote to encourage collaboration and peer learning. The goal is to reduce friction in the learning process while keeping teachers and students at the centre.

---

## üéØ Problem
- **Universities without forums:** Students lack a course-specific place to get reliable answers. Generic AI tools can give off-spec or misleading advice.  
- **Universities with forums:** Traditional forums get clogged with repetitive admin questions, slowing response times and crowding out deeper, content-focused discussion.

---

## üí° Solution
- **Teachers** upload subject materials and manage classes.  
- **AI assistant** answers repeat admin queries using only approved sources.  
- **Forum** handles new, content-heavy questions so students and teachers can discuss them properly.  
- Think of it as an **AI-integrated Reddit for educators** that enhances learning rather than replacing it.

- **Posts, replies and upvotes** for peer collaboration
